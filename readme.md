 # TikTok follower crawler
 
I get enough from fake videos in TikTok what follows the "I coded something to do something when I gain a new follower" trends.

## Purpose
Making this project to be a ** holder ** for different approaches, what makes it possible to create various events when a follower gained or lost. 
Pull request and different language and platform solutions are highly welcomed.

## Approaches

### Java based
I created a basic implementation of an event based follower lookup app based on Java/Spring Boot/Gradle
Currently not working, problem caused by the TikTok web API. Currently working on it.

### Future approaches

Planned a ESM32/Arduino based approach, to controll various microntrollers and devices.
